# Court Response to Charged Offense: Parent Contributing to Nonattendance

To the Honorable Court:

I, J. Michael Morris, respectfully submit this response regarding the charge of "Parent Contributing to Nonattendance" related to my son, Ky'vek Reynolds.

### Statement of Facts:

1. On September 3, 2024, my son Ky'vek Reynolds was the victim of a serious incident at Wells Middle School, where he was physically harmed by another student. Despite clear video evidence, school officials failed to acknowledge the severity of the incident, resulting in inadequate measures to ensure Ky'vek’s safety.

2. Subsequent to the incident, I repeatedly sought a concrete, actionable safety plan from Spring Independent School District (Spring ISD) to ensure my son’s safe return to school. My requests for such a plan and transportation assistance were continually ignored or inadequately addressed by the district.

3. Due to the district’s negligence in ensuring Ky'vek’s safety, I implemented an alternative educational arrangement, actively engaging Ky'vek in a rigorous, advanced homeschool curriculum specifically designed to exceed traditional Gifted and Talented (GT) learning standards.

4. Documentation clearly indicates consistent communication with Spring ISD, explicitly stating Ky'vek’s active engagement in this advanced homeschooling program and formally requesting district acknowledgment and collaboration.

5. Despite proactive and documented efforts to communicate and collaborate with Spring ISD, including involving higher authorities such as Congressman Dan Crenshaw, Spring ISD continued to inaccurately record attendance, failing to recognize or properly document Ky'vek’s legitimate and structured homeschool participation.

6. The inadequate response from Spring ISD necessitated daily transportation arrangements to a school (Claughton Middle School), significantly impacting our family financially and emotionally. Claughton Middle School, moreover, is documented as having substantial performance concerns (30% literacy rate), making it unsuitable and unsafe for Ky'vek.

### Supporting Documentation Provided:

* Detailed communications with Spring ISD explicitly addressing safety concerns and requesting an actionable safety plan.
* Official correspondence involving Congressman Dan Crenshaw regarding the incident and subsequent safety and educational concerns.
* Documentation of formal complaints filed with the Texas Education Agency regarding Spring ISD's administrative and educational negligence.

### Request for Court Consideration:

I respectfully request that the court dismiss the charges against me for "Parent Contributing to Nonattendance," acknowledging that my actions were in direct response to Spring ISD's negligence, failure to guarantee student safety, and refusal to accurately recognize Ky'vek’s active and advanced educational engagement through homeschooling.

Further, I request the court mandate corrective actions by Spring ISD to:

* Correct attendance records reflecting Ky'vek’s active participation in homeschooling.
* Facilitate appropriate placement at a safe and academically rigorous school.
* Provide compensation for documented transportation expenses incurred due to district-imposed school placements.

I trust that this documentation and context clarify the circumstances surrounding the nonattendance charges and demonstrate my proactive and responsible actions as a parent in ensuring the safety, education, and well-being of my son.

Respectfully submitted,
