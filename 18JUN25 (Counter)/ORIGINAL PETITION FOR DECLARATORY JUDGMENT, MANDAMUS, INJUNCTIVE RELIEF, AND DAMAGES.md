**Cause No. \[XXXX]**
**§**
**ORIGINAL PETITION FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, MANDAMUS, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES**

---

### I. PARTIES AND SERVICE

1. **Plaintiff** J. Michael Morris is a resident of \Harris, Texas, and may be served at \ 9595 Six Pines, Building 8, Level 2, Suite 8210, The Woodlands, Texas 77380.
2. **Defendant** Spring Independent School District (“Spring ISD”) is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and may be served through its Superintendent at 10025 Hufsmith Road, Spring, Texas 77388.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has **jurisdiction** under Texas Education Code section 25.093’s implementing procedures in section 25.0952, empowering the court to hear parent-contributing nonattendance matters and related mandamus actions ([statutes.capitol.texas.gov][1]).
4. Venue is proper in \[County] County under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 15.002 because Spring ISD’s central administration is located here.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On **September 3, 2024**, Ky’vek Reynolds, a seventh grader at Wells Middle School, was stabbed by another student; Spring ISD officials refused to implement a concrete, signed safety plan despite video and medical evidence.
6. Plaintiff repeatedly demanded a fully articulated safety plan and transportation assistance; Spring ISD ignored or provided inadequate responses, jeopardizing Ky’vek’s safety and well-being.
7. In response, Plaintiff established an **advanced homeschool program** through ARKTIK Initiative; Spring ISD nonetheless marked Ky’vek truant and later placed him at Claughton Middle School—a campus with a 30 percent literacy rate—imposing daily Uber costs of approximately \$57.
8. During Fall 2024, Spring ISD’s President and Vice President—met at a public event—claimed no knowledge of the stabbing or any ensuing investigation, confirming a breakdown in district-level communication.

### IV. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

#### A. **Declaratory Judgment**

9. Plaintiff requests a declaration that:
   a. Spring ISD violated **Texas Education Code § 25.093** by failing to accommodate legitimate homeschooling and by misreporting attendance for criminal-negligence warnings ([codes.findlaw.com][2]).
   b. Under **Texas Education Code § 25.0952**, Spring ISD must use Chapter 45A procedures for any “parent contributing to nonattendance” action; these were not followed ([statutes.capitol.texas.gov][1]).

#### B. **Mandamus Relief**

10. Plaintiff seeks mandamus compelling Spring ISD to:
    a. Correct Ky’vek’s attendance records to reflect valid homeschool participation.
    b. Provide or fund transportation to a safe and academically rigorous campus (Roberson Middle or Spring Leadership Academy).
    c. Execute and deliver a comprehensive, signed safety plan for Ky’vek’s return to any Spring ISD campus.

#### C. **Injunctive Relief**

11. Plaintiff requests a temporary and permanent injunction enjoining Spring ISD from:
    a. Recording or prosecuting any further “Parent Contributing to Nonattendance” charges against Plaintiff without strict compliance with sections 25.093–25.0952.
    b. Unilaterally reassigning Ky’vek to any campus without prior court-approved safety measures.

#### D. **Damages**

12. **Financial Restitution:** Reimbursement for documented transportation costs (\$57/day) from January through June 2025.
13. **Emotional Distress Compensation:** Damages for psychological harm and social-development setbacks suffered by Ky’vek and family, exacerbated by district negligence and unmanaged campus violence.
14. **Attorney’s Fees and Costs:** Under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 38.001 and Texas Government Code § 2001.038.

### V. PRAYER

**WHEREFORE**, Plaintiff prays that the Court:

1. **Declare** Defendant’s attendance-reporting and safety-planning practices unlawful under Texas Education Code §§ 25.093 and 25.0952.
2. **Mandamus** Spring ISD to correct attendance records, implement a safety plan, and fund appropriate placement and transportation.
3. **Enjoin** further noncompliant attendance or placement decisions absent full statutory and court-approved procedures.
4. **Award** Plaintiff reimbursement of transportation expenses and damages for emotional distress.
5. **Award** Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs.
6. Grant Plaintiff any other relief, at law or in equity, to which he is justly entitled.

Respectfully submitted,

J. Michael Morris
