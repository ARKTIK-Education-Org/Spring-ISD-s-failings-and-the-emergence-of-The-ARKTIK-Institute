---

## III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

1. On September 3, 2024, Plaintiff's son, Ky’vek Morris, a seventh grader at Wells Middle School, was stabbed in the arm with a sharpened pencil by another student, resulting in puncture wounds. Plaintiff immediately reported the injury to school administrators and documented the wound by video (see Exhibit A: [YouTube Evidence](https://youtu.be/CQt4-bbswGc)).

2. School officials, including the nurse, materially misrepresented the injury in official reports forwarded to the Harris County District Attorney, stating falsely that the injury did not break the skin, contrary to photographic and video evidence.

3. Spring ISD failed to initiate an immediate investigation, failed to remove the aggressor, and failed to implement a signed, actionable safety plan, placing Ky’vek’s well-being and academic progress at ongoing risk.

4. Plaintiff repeatedly communicated with district officials, including Ms. Lim, the district assistant superintendant,  Mr. Buckley ,the district’s General Counsel, snf the districts Director of Technology,from September 2024 through the end of the school year, seeking resolution and transparency. Not once during this period did Spring ISD or any party raise a credible concern about educational neglect or child endangerment.

5. On or about February 2025, Plaintiff notified Spring ISD in writing of his intention to formally homeschool Ky’vek, and continued all communications in good faith. (See attached Declaration, Exhibit B.)

6. Despite this notice, Spring ISD continued to mark Ky’vek as absent, refused to correct attendance records, and filed criminal charges against Plaintiff in May 2025. Notably, the formal truancy notice is dated May 19, 2025, just two days after Ky’vek’s thirteenth birthday, and on or about the day Superintendent Dr. Lupita Hinojosa retired.

7. These actions have imposed direct and collateral harm on Plaintiff, including reputational damage, lost educational revenue, legal fees, and emotional distress. Plaintiff is preparing to launch a private educational institute and must defend his name and operations against baseless criminal allegations timed to coincide with enrollment and IRS approval cycles.

8. Defendant was at all times aware of the operational status of Plaintiff’s homeschool initiative, as demonstrated by email records and continuous correspondence dating back to February 2025 (see Declaration, Exhibit B), and did not act upon any mandatory reporting or child safety concerns until after the school year ended and Plaintiff’s business was operational.

## IV. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

### A. Declaratory Judgment

Plaintiff requests a declaration that:
a. Spring ISD’s conduct violated Texas Education Code § 25.093 by failing to acknowledge legitimate homeschooling and misreporting attendance;
b. Under Texas Education Code § 25.0952, Spring ISD was required to use statutory procedures for any “parent contributing to nonattendance” action and failed to do so.

### B. Mandamus Relief

a. Correct Ky’vek’s attendance records to reflect lawful homeschool participation;
b. Refrain from prosecuting any “nonattendance” claim based on periods when Ky’vek was being properly homeschooled and district was on notice;
c. Execute and deliver a comprehensive, signed safety plan prior to any return or assignment of Ky’vek to any Spring ISD campus.

### C. Injunctive Relief

Plaintiff requests a temporary and permanent injunction:

2. Damages for reputational harm, lost enrollments, IRS application risk, and emotional distress;
3. Attorney’s fees and costs under Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 38.001.

---

## V. MOTION FOR EXPEDITED HEARING

Plaintiff moves for an expedited hearing pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 680 and applicable local rules, on grounds that: (1) the impending school year and IRS application window require urgent resolution to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiff’s educational enterprise, reputation, and the welfare of all affected students; and (2) the underlying criminal charges, if not immediately addressed, will cause lasting and compounding injury to Plaintiff’s business and standing in the community.

Plaintiff respectfully requests a hearing on all temporary and permanent injunctive relief and declaratory claims at the Court’s earliest possible convenience, and asks that Defendant be required to respond promptly to this Petition.

## VI. PRAYER

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court:

1. Declare Defendant’s attendance and safety-related practices unlawful under Texas Education Code §§ 25.093 and 25.0952;
2. Mandamus Spring ISD to correct all attendance records, recognize Plaintiff’s homeschool status, and provide a full safety plan;
3. Enjoin Spring ISD from further action to harm Plaintiff’s reputation, operations, or legal rights absent full statutory process;
4. Award Plaintiff all damages and costs as outlined above;
5. Grant Plaintiff such other relief as equity and justice require.

# EXHIBIT B: Declaration of Homeschool Notice and Correspondence

**DECLARATION OF J. MICHAEL MORRIS**

1. My name is J. Michael Morris. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and competent to make this declaration. The facts stated herein are true and correct and are based on my personal knowledge and direct correspondence.

2. Beginning in February 2025, I notified Spring Independent School District officials, via email and other documented communication, of my intent to transition my son, Ky’vek Morris, to a full-time homeschool program (ARKTIK Homeschool/Institute). This notification included detailed descriptions of the educational model, schedules, compliance with state law, and continued invitations for district collaboration and transparency.

3. At all times from February 2025 onward, Spring ISD and its representatives were in continuous receipt of email and written notices confirming my son’s lawful participation in homeschooling. At no point did any district employee, official, or representative express concern about child neglect, abuse, or educational deficiency in response to these notices.

4. Spring ISD’s continued reporting of absences and pursuit of criminal charges, despite clear written notice and ongoing correspondence, was without factual or legal basis and has caused irreparable harm to my reputation and business operations.

5. I respectfully submit this declaration in support of all relief requested in my Petition, under penalty of perjury, and attach supporting correspondence and records as needed.

Executed this \18SEP25, 2025, in Harris County, Texas.
