**RE: Request for Judicial Review and Entry of Evidence – Cause No. \[Insert #], Morris v. Spring Independent School District**

Dear Judge Korduba,

I respectfully write as Plaintiff in the above-referenced matter to request that the Court review the attached Amended Original Petition and all supporting evidence, and to grant consideration for an expedited hearing due to the severe, ongoing harm caused by Spring ISD’s actions against myself and my son, Ky’vek Reynolds.

**Context and Relevance of Federal Elected Official’s Involvement**
Throughout this ordeal, I made multiple attempts to engage Spring ISD in direct, constructive dialogue regarding the safety and educational future of my son. When district channels failed to provide resolution, I reached out to Congressman Dan Crenshaw for help. Congressman Crenshaw himself responded personally and encouraged me to contact his staff for any further assistance needed. This direct support from our federal representative affirmed the gravity and legitimacy of our situation, and was instrumental in the creation of the ARKTIK Institute—a local education initiative aligned with Texas law and evolving online learning requirements.

**Summary of Issues and Evidence**
Despite clear written notice as early as February 2025 of our intent to homeschool, Spring ISD has continued to misreport Ky’vek’s attendance, pursue punitive criminal charges, and undermine our educational initiative at a pivotal time for enrollment and IRS approval. The evidence I submit includes:

* Video documentation of a Spring ISD officer confirming that material facts about my son’s stabbing were misrepresented to the District Attorney ([video link](https://youtu.be/CQt4-bbswGc));
* Declarations and timelines establishing ongoing compliance and communication with the district;
* Direct correspondence with Congressman Crenshaw’s office and other public officials.

**Urgency and Requested Relief**
The actions of Spring ISD now threaten not only our family, but the broader community’s right to safe, effective, and innovative educational options. Given that Texas now mandates online access for all students, and ARKTIK has proactively developed such a solution, I respectfully request:

* That this letter and all attached evidence be entered into the official record;
* That the Court review the materials in full and consider the wider public interest and legislative context;
* That a speedy hearing or trial be set to prevent further irreparable harm to our school’s reputation, enrollment, and compliance with state and federal standards.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. Should the Court need any further information or clarification, I am available at any time.

Respectfully,

**J. Michael Morris**
