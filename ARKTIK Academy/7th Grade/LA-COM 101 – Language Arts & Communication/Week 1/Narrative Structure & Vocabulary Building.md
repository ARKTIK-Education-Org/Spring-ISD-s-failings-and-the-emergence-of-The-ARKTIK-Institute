### Phase 1: Insight Card (Lesson Content)

#### What is a Narrative?

A narrative is a story—it could be true or made up. Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Great stories use powerful words and structure to help readers *see* and *feel* what’s happening.

**Mini-Example:**  
> "Yesterday, I opened my lemonade stand for the first time. At first, nobody came. Then, after I made a big sign, my friends lined up to try it!"

**Your Turn:**  
In your journal, write the *beginning* of a story about something new you’ve tried. Just a few sentences!

---

### Phase 2: Demonstration

Write a short story (6–10 sentences) about a time you tried something for the first time.  
- Use at least three vocabulary words from this week’s list (provided below).
- Make sure your story has a clear beginning, middle, and end.

**Submit:**  
Upload or paste your story in the ARKTIK Digital Journal space in the LMS.

---

### Phase 3: Assembly

Take a quick “Assembly” check:
- List the three vocabulary words you used.
- Briefly explain (1–2 sentences each):  
   - Why did you choose those words?
   - What makes a good ending for a story?

**Submit:**  
Complete in the LMS check-in or journal.

---

### Phase 4: Reflection

**Prompt:**  
What was the hardest part about writing your story?  
How did you decide how your story would end?  
Would you do anything differently if you wrote it again?

**Submit:**  
Write your response in your ARKTIK Reflection Journal.

---

### **Phase 5: Production – Accountability Threshold**

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate operational proficiency in Week 1’s core skill: writing a structured narrative.

**Instructions:**  
- Revise your story using the feedback from Demonstration, Assembly, and Reflection.
- Submit your *final* narrative as a clean, single paragraph.
- Your teacher or parent QA lead will use the ARKTIK checklist to confirm that your story:
  - Has a clear beginning, middle, and end
  - Uses vocabulary correctly
  - Shows effort in revision

**Certification:**  
Only students who pass this Production milestone advance to Week 2. Feedback and resubmission are encouraged until operational mastery is confirmed.

---

## Teacher/Parent Guidance Notes (Hidden)

- Review each student’s work using the ARKTIK operational checklist.
- Provide constructive, specific feedback—focus on structure, clarity, and vocabulary use.
- Confirm “Production” before marking the week complete in the progress tracker.
