# Case for Formal Investigation into Spring ISD’s Failings and the ARKTIK Institute Roadmap

## Background of the Incident and Initial Response

On September 3, 2024, a violent safety incident occurred at Wells Middle School involving my child, **Ky’vek Reynolds**. During class, another student (identified as Jayden) allegedly stabbed Ky’vek in the arm with a sharpened pencil. This attack left my child physically injured and deeply shaken. We immediately reported the incident to school administration. However, the initial response from the school was **inadequate and alarmingly slow**:

* **No Immediate Investigation:** The Assistant Principal, Mr. Osita Ezeielo, admitted in a phone conversation that **no investigation had been initiated** in the day following the incident. Incredibly, the delay was attributed to a trivial clerical confusion – the offending student’s name wasn’t immediately found on the class roster due to a missing initial. It was only after **I provided the correct last-name initial** (during a recorded call) that the administrator was able to identify the student and begin looking into the matter. This oversight and lack of urgency in a serious assault case is *deeply troubling*.

* **Victim Kept Home, Aggressor Remained in Class:** In the absence of prompt action, I had no choice but to **keep my child at home for his safety**. Meanwhile, the student who committed the attack was allowed to remain in class with peers, potentially posing a continued threat to others. **No immediate protective measures** (such as removing or suspending the aggressor) were taken to safeguard other students. This meant that the *burden of disruption fell entirely on the victim*, who was deprived of his education while the aggressor continued attending school unimpeded.

* **Lack of Communication:** In the critical 48 hours after the incident, communication from the school was **minimal and frustrating**. I received no proactive updates. I had to initiate contact repeatedly to get any information. The onus fell on me, as the parent of the injured child, to chase down administrators for a response, compounding the stress of the situation.

On September 4, 2024 (the day after the incident), having seen no effective action, I sent a **formal written complaint** to the Spring ISD School Board and district officials. In that letter, I urgently requested a series of remedial actions, including:

1. **A Formal Investigation** into the stabbing incident and the school’s handling of it, with a clear timeline and a full report of findings.
2. **A Review of School Safety Protocols**, specifically how violent incidents are handled and how repeat offenders are managed, to prevent such lapses in the future.
3. **Accountability for Staff** involved in the mishandling – for example, disciplinary action for the Assistant Principal (and others, if applicable) whose inattention led to the delayed response.
4. **Assurances of Protection** for my child (and other students), such as concrete measures to keep the aggressor away from victims and to ensure my child could return to a safe learning environment.
5. **A Formal Apology** from the school administration for the inadequate response to such a serious incident.

This letter underscored that the situation was *unacceptable*, noting that the school’s failure to act swiftly not only endangered my child but also **“places other students at risk.”** I implored the board to recognize the gravity of what happened and take **swift, decisive action** to correct these failures.

## Timeline of Escalation and District Response

**September 5–6, 2024:** My complaint quickly reached Spring ISD’s administration. On Sept 5, I received an email from Mr. Jeremy Binkley, the district’s General Counsel, indicating that the Assistant Superintendent for Middle Schools, Mrs. Nirmol Lim, had attempted to contact me by phone. Unfortunately, due to a mix-up (she had been calling an office number after hours), we initially missed each other. I promptly provided my correct contact information and availability. By the next day (Sept 6), I still had not connected with Mrs. Lim, so I sent a follow-up email emphasizing that **my child was still at home, with the issue unresolved** and no clear plan in place – a delay I described as unacceptable given the ongoing safety concern.

Later on September 6, Mr. Binkley clarified the phone confusion and assured me that Mrs. Lim would reach out again that day. True to his word, Mrs. Lim and I finally spoke that afternoon in a detailed conversation about the incident and my concerns. This conversation, and a follow-up email from her, revealed the **initial actions** the district started taking (belatedly) in response to my complaint:

* **Disciplinary Action:** Mrs. Lim stated that **disciplinary actions had been taken**. Citing privacy laws, she could not reveal specifics, but this implied that the student who attacked my child faced consequences. (It’s worth noting that this discipline only occurred after my formal complaint and insistence – highlighting that without parental pressure, the incident might have gone unaddressed longer.)

* **Involvement of Law Enforcement:** Recognizing the seriousness of a stabbing (even with a pencil), the district involved the police. Mrs. Lim indicated that **Officer Barner** of the Spring ISD Police would contact me to discuss filing appropriate charges. This step was crucial, as the incident constituted an assault. (It also suggests the school had not initially treated it with the gravity required – normally, such an incident should prompt immediate security or police intervention, not *days* later after parental outcry.)

* **Stopgap Safety Measures:** Mrs. Lim acknowledged that, in the interim, they had **separated the students** – ensuring that my child and the aggressor would not share classes upon my child’s return. However, I had already made it clear to the administration that this measure was **insufficient** by itself. Simply shuffling schedules is a *reactive* step; it doesn’t address the root cause or adequately reassure us of my child’s safety. At this point, I informed her that I would need additional time to consider a longer-term resolution (for instance, whether my child would even return to that school or if other safety accommodations were necessary).

* **Addressing Internal Protocols:** Importantly, Mrs. Lim noted that she had **“addressed the issues related to due diligence and customer service on campus.”** This was essentially an admission that the school’s handling fell short. The fact that *internal “customer service” and diligence needed addressing* speaks volumes. I interpret this as the district recognizing that Wells Middle School staff failed to follow proper procedure and did not treat the situation with the urgency and care it warranted. It suggests retraining or corrective guidance was given to the school’s leadership on how to manage such incidents and communicate with parents.

In that communication, Mrs. Lim apologized for the confusion and delays, and expressed **commitment to improving safety protocols**. She invited me to provide any further suggestions and to keep an open line of communication with her. By the end of that first week, the district was finally taking the matter seriously – but only after my persistent pressure.

It was clear to me that **had I not escalated the issue to the school board and district leadership, the incident might have been swept under the rug**. These events revealed *systemic issues* in Spring ISD’s response to school violence: poor internal communication, lack of urgency, and inadequate support for victims. This solidified my resolve to pursue a formal external investigation, to ensure accountability and prevent future failures.

## Identified Failings of Spring ISD in This Case

Based on the above timeline, several key failings in Spring ISD’s handling of the incident have been identified:

* **1. Delay and Negligence in Investigation:** The administration did not immediately investigate a clear case of on-campus violence. The Assistant Principal’s inability to find the student’s name on a roster (until prompted by the parent) indicates a troubling level of negligence. Critical hours (if not days) were lost when evidence could have been gathered and witness statements taken. Such delay not only hampers fact-finding but also sends a message of *indifference* toward student safety.

* **2. Failure to Protect Students Post-Incident:** After the attack, the aggressor was not removed from the classroom environment. Standard safety protocol should prioritize removing a potential threat; instead, the victim was effectively the one removed (kept home). This is a failure to protect not just my child but also classmates who were left in a classroom with a student who had demonstrated violent behavior. It reflects a *reactive* rather than proactive approach to school safety.

* **3. Inadequate Communication and Transparency:** The school’s communication with the affected family (us) was unacceptably poor. We received no timely updates; phone calls were missed or misdirected; and I had to resort to writing to the school board to get attention. A critical incident like this should trigger immediate and ongoing communication with the victim’s family – including what steps are being taken – but that did not happen. This lack of transparency erodes trust and left us feeling that the issue was not a priority for the school.

* **4. Lack of Proper Protocol/Training:** The phrase “due diligence and customer service” used by the Assistant Superintendent to describe issues she had to address internally suggests that staff at Wells Middle School may lack training in handling such incidents. Proper protocol (for example, **immediately securing the scene, tending to the victim’s medical needs, documenting the incident, notifying district security/police, contacting both students’ parents, and swiftly beginning an investigation**) should be second nature in a violent incident. The observed response indicates protocol was either not in place or not followed. This failing points to possible gaps in Spring ISD’s training and oversight of campus administrators.

* **5. Insufficient Interim Measures:** Even once the issue was recognized, the interim solution of separating the students’ schedules was a **minimal** response. It did not address deeper concerns: Would there be supervision to ensure no contact during unstructured times (hallways, lunch)? What about the psychological impact on my child – how would the school support him on return? These questions remained unanswered. In short, the school’s plan seemed to be “keep them apart for now” without a comprehensive safety or support strategy, which is an inadequate response to a violent incident.

Each of these points represents a serious failing on the part of Spring ISD (and Wells Middle School specifically) in their duty to ensure a safe learning environment. Together, they paint a picture of an incident that was mishandled at multiple levels, warranting further scrutiny.

## Parent’s Proactive Response: Developing the ARKTIK Institute

Faced with the school’s failures and the reality that my child was stuck at home for his safety, I realized I needed to take proactive steps to ensure his continued education and well-being. Out of this adversity, **The ARKTIK Institute** (also known as the ARKTIK Initiative) was born. This was our family’s solution to not only keep Ky’vek’s education on track, but to **reimagine a better learning environment** that prioritizes safety, values, and real-world skills.

**What is ARKTIK?** ARKTIK is a modern education initiative we founded, dedicated to preparing students and adult learners for leadership in fields like agriculture, technology, and sustainability. It combines *timeless wisdom* and *faith-based values* with cutting-edge innovation to empower learners. In essence, it is both an alternative learning pathway (for homeschooling or supplementary education) and a community movement. Notably, ARKTIK explicitly stands for **the rights of parents and the empowerment of learners** – principles that became especially important to us after our experience. As stated in our charter, *“we stand for the rights of parents, the preservation of traditional values, and the empowerment of every learner to lead with courage and conviction.”*

**The ARKTIK Method – Chats, Projects, and Hands-On Learning:** Starting in late 2024, we engaged in what we call the “ARKTIK Method” of learning. This meant turning our kitchen table into a classroom and our family projects into learning opportunities. We leveraged all tools at our disposal, including modern AI tutoring and good old-fashioned experimentation. Through **numerous chats and experiments** (many of them guided by educational AI platforms and resources), we developed a series of projects that Ky’vek and I would work on together. We built small prototypes, wrote and tested code, and explored topics ranging from programming to sustainable farming. In these projects, **Ky’vek and I both acted as QA testers** – ensuring that each solution or experiment we created was functional and high-quality. This not only improved our projects, but also taught my child critical thinking and debugging skills in a very hands-on way.

One core philosophy drove our work: *learning by doing*. We weren’t just reading textbooks; we were actively building and problem-solving. ARKTIK’s educational framework, in fact, encapsulates this idea with the motto: **“Learn by Doing. Master by Serving. Lead by Example.”** This means that students gain knowledge through real execution of tasks, reinforce their mastery by contributing or teaching (serving others), and develop leadership by setting positive examples. We put this into practice every day. For example, rather than just learning programming theory, Ky’vek helped me **develop actual software repositories** and acted as a user tester for them. Rather than only studying environmental science, we physically worked on a micro-farming project in our yard.

**Project Roadmap and Timeline:** Over the next several months (Fall 2024 into 2025), what started as ad-hoc learning activities evolved into a structured roadmap for the ARKTIK Institute:

* *Fall 2024 (Immediately Post-Incident):* We focused on technology and coding as a constructive outlet. Using interactive coding lessons and AI support, Ky’vek began learning the C# programming language. We treated this as a collaborative project – setting up a small repository for his code exercises and gradually building on them. At the same time, I began documenting a broader vision for ARKTIK. We outlined our core **mission and values** in writing, emphasizing selflessness, integrity, accountability, and community resilience. These early documents became the foundation of ARKTIK’s charter and curriculum plans.

* *Winter 2024–2025:* Our projects expanded into new areas aligned with ARKTIK’s mission. **Sustainable agriculture** was one such area. Together, we designed a prototype for *ARKTIK MicroFarms* – an initiative to convert backyards into sustainable micro-farms for local food security. We developed guides and experimented in our own backyard garden, learning about soil, planting cycles, and simple IoT sensor integration for monitoring plants. This became a blueprint for community micro-farming that we eventually folded into ARKTIK’s programs. Simultaneously, we continued the tech learning track. By now, Ky’vek was building small programs in C# and gaining confidence. We also instilled a practice of documentation – every experiment or project, we documented what we did, what worked, and what didn’t. This instilled not only technical skills but also accountability and communication skills in him.

* *Spring 2025:* By spring, the fruits of the ARKTIK Method were becoming evident. **Ky’vek achieved a major milestone: he earned the Foundational C# Programming Certification offered through Microsoft’s learning platform in collaboration with freeCodeCamp.** This certification is a globally available program comprising roughly 35 hours of training on Microsoft Learn, capped by a comprehensive exam. That means over the course of a few months, working part-time on this, an 11-year-old middle schooler was able to cover an entire foundational course in a professional programming language and successfully pass an 80-question certification exam. This accomplishment is a testament to the effectiveness of project-based, self-paced learning. The fact that Microsoft’s program is free and open meant we could pursue it from home, and Ky’vek’s success in obtaining the certificate demonstrated his *mastery of the material*. It’s not just a piece of paper – it’s an objective validation of skills that are often taught at a high school or even college level. I firmly believe that without the ARKTIK Method driving his curiosity and discipline, this might not have been possible at his age. (And importantly, this happened while he was **out of the traditional classroom**, refuting any notion that keeping him home for safety meant his education would stagnate.)

* *Spring–Summer 2025:* Building on our momentum, we formally established **The ARKTIK Institute/Initiative as a nonprofit educational venture**. We filed for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS and began developing a public-facing presence. We created the ARKTIK website and a GitHub organization to share our work openly. The *ARKTIK Access* GitHub repository was set up as the hub for all our curriculum, projects, and community guidelines, reflecting our commitment to “execution-based learning” and transparent community-building. The repository and site detail all our programs – from the **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.)** which outlines learning pathways and skill tracks, to our **ARKTIK Lifestyle** and **Community Governance** documents which ensure that fun, fellowship, and ethical leadership are baked into this initiative. We also built out features like the **ARKTIK Card** (a financing tool to help families afford educational resources) and set up membership structures so other families could join this movement. By mid-2025, ARKTIK was officially announcing its first offerings for students: for example, we began **accepting applications for a K–12 preparatory program for the Fall 2025–2026 school year**. In addition, we launched **ARKTIK Membership** plans to involve parents, students, and supporters. Membership offers families access to resources for homeschooling, priority in enrollment for programs, workshops on STEM and AgriTech, and advocacy support for dealing with school districts. The very idea of providing advocacy resources grew directly out of our ordeal – we want to empower other parents to navigate school bureaucracy and assert their children’s rights, which is something we struggled with during the Wells MS incident.

In summary, from the ashes of a **failure in the school system**, we built a proactive solution. ARKTIK Institute has grown from a stop-gap homeschool project into a budding educational community that emphasizes **safety, personal values, practical skills, and parent involvement**. This journey has not only kept Ky’vek safe and learning in the short term, but it has opened up a pathway for many others who seek a better way to educate and protect their children. It demonstrates that when a school system falls short, families *can* find innovative ways to adapt – but it should never have come to this. We would have preferred our child receive a safe, quality education in his public school. ARKTIK is not meant to replace the school’s responsibilities; rather, it highlights what can be achieved when those responsibilities are not met and parents are forced to take charge.

## Request for a Formal Investigation

Despite the positive outcomes we’ve created for our family through ARKTIK, the fact remains that **Spring ISD must answer for the failings** in this incident. I am formally requesting an **independent, thorough investigation** into how Spring ISD, and Wells Middle School in particular, handled the events of September 3, 2024 and the days that followed. This investigation should be conducted by a body or individuals **outside the direct chain of command of those involved** (to ensure impartiality), and it should address the following points in detail:

* **Circumstances of the Incident:** Confirm the facts of the classroom assault (time, location, context) and whether appropriate immediate actions (first aid, student separation, incident reporting) were taken by the supervising teacher and administrators on the scene.

* **Administrative Response Timeline:** Examine the timeline of the school’s response (or lack thereof) in the 24–48 hours post-incident. Why was there a delay in identifying the offending student? Was the principal or school safety officer notified immediately? If not, why not? The investigation should review communications and logs at the campus level to see where the breakdown occurred.

* **Protocol Assessment:** Determine if Wells Middle School followed Spring ISD’s own policies for handling student violence. If policies were not followed, identify *which* policies were ignored or mishandled (e.g., did the campus violate any Spring ISD safety protocol or Texas Education Code requirements for reporting a violent incident?). If the proper protocols are lacking, the investigation should flag this as a needed area of improvement for the district.

* **Accountability for Staff:** Evaluate the actions of specific staff members. This includes the Assistant Principal who oversaw discipline/investigation, and any other staff who had a duty to respond. If they failed to act in accordance with expected standards, the investigation should recommend appropriate personnel actions or retraining. The fact that **the Assistant Superintendent herself had to “address due diligence and customer service” issues at the campus** indicates that staff performance was an issue – this needs to be verified and formally addressed, not just informally corrected.

* **Communication Failures:** Investigate the communication chain. Was the Spring ISD administration (Area Superintendent, General Counsel) aware of the incident only after I emailed them, or had the school reported it up the chain as they should? Why did it require a school board complaint for the issue to be taken seriously? Additionally, assess how communication with me (the parent) was handled – there should be standards for keeping parents informed during emergencies, and those appear to have been lacking.

* **Student Safety and Well-being:** Critically, the investigation should examine how the district’s handling impacted the safety and well-being of both my child and other students. For instance, leaving the aggressor in class – was this in line with any “least disruptive” policy, or simply an oversight? How could the school have better supported my son while the situation was being resolved (counseling, academic accommodations, etc.)? We want to ensure that in the future, *victims are not the ones who suffer further by missing education*, and that aggressors receive appropriate interventions or removal to protect the school community.

* **Post-incident Remediation:** Lastly, I request that the investigation review what remedial steps Spring ISD has taken since September 2024 to fix these gaps. Mrs. Lim’s involvement and the subsequent measures (discipline, police report, etc.) were a start. But has Spring ISD implemented any lasting changes? For example, are **safety protocol reviews** underway district-wide? Have staff at Wells (or district-wide) been retrained on handling violence and communicating with parents? Are there new checks to ensure that something as simple as a name spelling issue won’t derail an urgent investigation? Transparency here is key – the investigation’s findings should include any positive changes made (or recommend those changes if they haven’t been made yet).

The ultimate goal of this formal investigation is not punitive for its own sake – it is to **ensure accountability and improvement**. Students and parents deserve to know that when a child is attacked at school, the response will be swift, thorough, and compassionate. In our case, it was not. We need to fix that system so it *never happens again* to anyone else.

I also believe that an investigation will validate our experience and perhaps even provide **closure**. An official acknowledgment of what went wrong and an apology from Spring ISD would be appropriate, as I requested initially. Owning the mistakes is the first step to restoring trust.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our case highlights a stark contrast between what **should** happen in a school crisis and what *did* happen – and how a determined parent had to step in to fill the void. Spring ISD’s failure to respond adequately to a serious safety incident is a matter of grave concern. I have outlined the timeline and specifics of those failures and formally requested an investigation to address them.

At the same time, I have detailed how our family responded by creating the ARKTIK Institute – turning a negative situation into a constructive, empowering journey for my child. ARKTIK is built on the belief that education can be safe, values-driven, and highly effective when approached with creativity and courage. In a few short months, Ky’vek went from being a **scared assault victim out of school** to a **confident learner with a C# programming certificate to his name** – all thanks to the ARKTIK Method and the support of family and innovative resources. This is a testament to resilience and the potential within every student when properly nurtured.

However, not every family has the ability or resources to do what we did. That is why fixing the system is critical. Parents shouldn’t have to pull their kids out of school and reinvent the wheel to guarantee safety and quality education. My hope is that Spring ISD takes our case as a wake-up call. By conducting a formal investigation and implementing the necessary reforms, the district can prevent future incidents and ensure that **every child’s right to a safe education is upheld**.

I appreciate your careful attention to this matter. Moving forward, I am willing to cooperate fully with investigators, share any documentation (emails, recorded calls, medical reports of the injury, etc.), and even share insights from our ARKTIK experience if it can help improve district practices. Our goal is not only to seek accountability but also to be part of the solution – whether that’s through ARKTIK or through working with Spring ISD to implement better policies.

**In summary, I urge Spring ISD and relevant oversight authorities to formally investigate this incident and the school’s response.** Doing so is necessary to restore trust, ensure justice, and protect our children. No family should have to experience what we did. Let this case be the catalyst for positive change in Spring Independent School District.
